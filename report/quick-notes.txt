notes adapted directly from my notebook

21/12/2020
--> attempted to implement bubblesort, took too long to sort 1 million ints
--> test further after other algos implemented
--> random number gen stops working past 2 million ints (segmentation fault), possibly due to insufficient memory on machine
--> before implementing the next algorithm, sort out makefile and add a way to get varied datasets in rand-ints.c

quicksort implementation
--> mistyped an index and put in the wrong value type when using quicksort in main.c (array[0] instead of 0)

22/12/20
--> timer was not working initially, fixed it to run based on CPU time rather than wall-clock time
--> added make test + tester shellscript for easier testing

28/12/20
--> added first attempted optimisation, replacing if statement in measure_runtime() in main.c with a switch statment
--> formatting of the output could be improved, as output order is based on types of arrays over sorting algorithms
--> program is no longer able to handle sorting 1000000 ints, might be to do with all the memory used
--> after further testing, it appears that the current machine may just not have enough memory to handle generating 1000000 ints, which will be further tested on other machines

30/12/20
--> implemented malloc() to array and workarray and solved the issue of the program being unable to handle over 1 million integers
--> spent so long in a detached head state and went a little bit mad because i didn't realise i was there for so long

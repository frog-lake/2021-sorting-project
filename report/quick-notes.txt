notes adapted directly from my notebook

21/12/2020
--> attempted to implement bubblesort, took too long to sort 1 million ints
--> test further after other algos implemented
--> random number gen stops working past 2 million ints (segmentation fault), possibly due to insufficient memory on machine
--> before implementing the next algorithm, sort out makefile and add a way to get varied datasets in rand-ints.c

quicksort implementation
--> mistyped an index and put in the wrong value type when using quicksort in main.c (array[0] instead of 0)

22/12/20
--> timer was not working initially, fixed it to run based on CPU time rather than wall-clock time
--> added make test + tester shellscript for easier testing
